          <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 325 F.</li>
            <li>Pour 1 cup of the sugar in a warm pan over medium heat. 
              Constantly stir the sugar while it heats until it browns and turns into caramelâ€”that is, becomes a dark-brown liquid.</li>
            <li>Immediately pour approximately 2 to 3 tablespoons of caramel in each of 6 individual custard dishes or ramekins, tilting them so the caramel swirls around on the inside. 
              Work quickly, as the caramel will cool and harden almost as soon as it hits the dish. Reheat caramel in the pan if it thickens too much to work with.</li>
            <li>In an electric mixer or with a whisk, blend the eggs together. Add all three cans of milk ( 1 condensed and 2 evaporated) and mix.</li>
            <li>Slowly mix in the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar, then the vanilla. Blend until smooth after each ingredient is added.</li>
            <li>Pour the custard mixture into the caramel-lined dishes, distributing it equally.</li>
            <li>Place the individual dishes in a large glass, ceramic, or metal baking pan. Pour hot water into the baking pan around the custard dishes to a depth of about 2 inches.</li>
            <li>Bake the flan for 45 minutes in the water bath. Check with a knife inserted just off-center into one of the servings; if the knife comes out clean, the flan is ready.</li>
            <li>Remove the large baking dish from the oven and carefully take the individual dishes out of the hot water. Let cool to room temperature, then place in the refrigerator for an hour or so. 
              (Leave flan in the dishes they baked in until time to serve.)</li>
            <li>To serve, invert each individual dish onto a small plate, allowing the flan to drop out and the caramel sauce to flow over the custard.</li>

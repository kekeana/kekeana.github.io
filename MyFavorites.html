          <p style="font-family:Abril Fatface;color:black;font-size:18px;"> As a foodie, it's hard to narrow down favorites. I mostly bake too. 
            But the three following are classic to my family: chilled strawberry soup, chocolate chip cookies, and flan.</p>

            <h1 style="text-align:center;">Books</h1>
        <p style="p">My favorite book that I read as a child was Walk Two Moons.</p>
        <p style="p">Salamanca Tree Hiddle, also known as Sal, has recently moved as a result of her parents divorce. Her mother disappeared and her dad decided to rent out their Kentucky farm to move to Ohio. While in Ohio, she embarks on a six-day road trip with her grandparents to Idaho in order to find her mother in time for the Mother's birthday. 
          Woven into the story of the roadtrip is Sal's story of her friend Phoebe, whose mother has disappeared as well. The road trip encompasses a mystery, a quest, and a love story. However, the road isn't as smooth for Sal finding her mother as it was for Phoebe.</p>
        <p style="p">Salamanca Tree Hiddle, Phoebe Winterbottom, Sal's Mother, The grandparents. </p>

              title="Walk Two Moons cover" style="width:309px;height:475px;">
        </a>
        <p style="p">This is my favorite book because it completely captured my attention when I first read it. The story of a young girl looking for her mother was very sweet and I loved hearing Sal's crazy stories. </p>

            <h1 style="text-align:center;">Movies</h1>
        <p style="font-family:Abril Fatface;color:black;font-size:18px;"> One of my all time favourite movies in Interstellar. </p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0vxOhd4qlnA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p style="p">In Earth's future, a global crop blight and second Dust Bowl are slowly rendering the planet uninhabitable. Professor Brand (Michael Caine), a brilliant NASA physicist, is working on plans to save mankind by transporting Earth's population to a new home via a wormhole. 
          But first, Brand must send former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) and a team of researchers through the wormhole and across the galaxy to find out which of three planets could be mankind's new home.</p>
